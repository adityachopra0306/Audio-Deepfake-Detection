# Summary and Analysis

## Implementation Process

### Challenges Encountered

- **Model Architecture Adaptation**: Adjusting SpecRNet to fit the specific audio format of ASVSpoof and use case.
- **Computational Constraints**: Ensuring the model could deliver strong performance while being subject to constraints caused due to Kaggle's CPU/GPU usage limits, which could translate to constraints that would allow running on local devices.

### Assumptions Made

- Model performance on the curated dataset would generalize well to real-world scenarios.
- Short audio clips (2–5 seconds) would provide sufficient signal for accurate classification.
- The model would be reliable across various accents and languages, although further evaluation is needed to confirm this.

## Model Analysis

### Why SpecRNet?

SpecRNet offers a strong balance of speed and accuracy, making it ideal for use cases where real-time or near real-time analysis is necessary. Its lightweight design enables deployment on a range of hardware, including edge devices—key for scalable implementation. It provides competitive performance to several State-of-the-art approaches, but achieves it at a much lower computation cost.

### How the Model Works

SpecRNet operates on spectrogram representations of audio and leverages a CNN-based architecture:

- Lightweight convolutional layers for early feature extraction.
- Residual blocks to capture deeper, more abstract patterns.
- Global average pooling followed by fully connected layers for classification.

By extracting both frequency and temporal domain features, SpecRNet can detect artifacts characteristic of synthetic speech.

### Real-World vs. Curated Dataset Performance

While the model performs strongly on my test set as is supported by research evidence, real-world conditions introduce variables like noise, compression artifacts, and unfamiliar accents. These could impact performance, emphasizing the need for further validation in the field.

### Additional Data/Resources for Improvement

- Larger, more varied real-world conversation datasets.
- Speech samples from a broader set of TTS and voice cloning models.
- High-quality recordings of diverse accents and speaking styles.
- Annotated edge cases such as voice actors and semi-synthetic content.

### Deployment Strategy

- Incorporate model versioning and A/B testing for controlled rollout.
- Set up detailed monitoring, logging, and feedback pipelines.
- Add a fallback mechanism (e.g., human review) for low-confidence predictions.
- Use reinforcement learning with human feedback to further fine-tune existing models.
- Ensure compliance with data privacy and ethical standards.
- Continuously retrain and update the model to deal with emerging deepfake technology.
